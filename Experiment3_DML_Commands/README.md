# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to reduce the reorder level by 30% where cost price is more than 50 and quantity in stock is less than 100 in the products table.

Products Table 

name          type       
----------    ---------- 
product_id     INT PRIMARY KEY        
product_name   VARCHAR(10) 
category       VARCHAR(50) 
cost_price     DECIMAL(10) 
sell_price     DECIMAL(10) 
reorder_lvl    INT        
quantity       INT        
supplier_id    INT   

```sql
UPDATE products
SET reorder_lvl = reorder_lvl * 0.7
WHERE cost_price > 50
  AND quantity < 100;
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Update the total selling price to quantity sold multiplied by updated selling price per unit where product id is 10 in the sales table.

SALES TABLE
name               type
-----------------  ---------------
sale_id            INT
sale_date          DATE
product_id         INT
quantity           INT
sell_price         DECIMAL(10,2)
total_sell_price   DECIMAL(10,2)

```sql
UPDATE sales
SET total_sell_price = quantity * sell_price
WHERE product_id = 10;
```

**Output:**

email
phone_number
